# CYSE 411 - Security Requirements

## üß™ Objective

This lab gives students hands-on experience eliciting **user stories**, **evil user stories**, and **security stories** from a real-world scenario involving a disaster response system ("Argus Crisis").

Students will read a provided **problem statement**, analyze the system, and write:

- User Stories (task-oriented)
- Evil User Stories (from attacker perspective)
- Security Stories (countermeasures)

All stories must follow the appropriate format and include acceptance criteria (when required).

#### The autograde does not check the semantic of the stories, only the syntax.
